<p>In this race towards success we all forgot to give time to ourselves, smiling is something for which you don't need any reason. Then why 
people all around me look disastrous. One has to work hard to keep the pot boiling.
 struggles are waiting for you dont escape as there is no easy way to the top. 
Uphill and downdale is  an option but remember in the race of doing something unforgettable you start forgetting everything.
 be decisive, be an optimistic person. Hold tight and enjoy the roller coaster of life.

<h2> Step out of the comfort zone. </h2> <button> LIKE </button>
<p> life will change you at every step, changing positively is your choice. At this point we meet new people.
We are introduced to good and bad things and this difference  of choosing the right  one will frustrate us sometimes.
 feeling low, getting depressed, loosing self confidence but being okay after a gap are normal things.
Life will confuse you from choosing a career to the path you want to follow but being pessimistic is not an option.
So worrying about what is and what is not is foolish. Live every moment.Not only talking about teenage and the emotions.
But also considering a normal human life i would suggest stop running aimlessly and  walk on a decided path.

<h3> Get inspired not influenced.</h3> <button> LIKE </button> 
<p> Inspirations will work for you. Get inspired not by an iitian or a billionaire but by normal people like you who tried,fell but didn’t stop.
Being inspired does not mean reading quotes, novels without applying them and changing  the way you live.
You have to do something for making a change.
Immediate results of your efforts won’t  come your way. 
Patience is an elixir for true success. 
I would suggest  you to take a deep breath and think.This time think of what you want to do not about what you need to.
In this race towards success don’t  forget that you came with nothing and you have to go empty-handed.</p>
